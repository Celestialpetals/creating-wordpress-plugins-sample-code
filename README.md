Creating Wordpress Plugins: Sample Code
================================================

This is the sample code from the book Creating and Selling Wordpress Plugins. 
Simply download and drop into /wp-content/plugins and you will see it appear in your Wordpress administration Plugins menu.

The plugin itself does nothing of value and only serves as an example of how to structure and use some of the main components of a Wordpres plugin.
